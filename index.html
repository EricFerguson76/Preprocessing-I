      <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I live in Pekin Illinois with my wife and three kids. I graduated
        college in 1998 with a Bachelors in Criminal Justice. In September of
        2019 I completed a Full Stack Web Development Course with Lambda School.
        Over the years my past work experiences has brought me across the paths
        of many types of people. They have all influenced me in different ways
        to become the person I am today. They have helped me sharpen my
        listening skills and have taught me patience when working with difficult
        people.
