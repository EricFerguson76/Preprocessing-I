        <h1>A Little About Me:</h1>
        <p>
          I live in Pekin Illinois with my wife and three kids. I graduated
          college in 1998 with a Bachelors in Criminal Justice. In September of
          2019 I completed a Full Stack Web Development Course with Lambda
          School. Over the years my past work experiences has brought me across
          the paths of many types of people. They have all influenced me in
          different ways to become the person I am today. They have helped me
          sharpen my listening skills and have taught me patience when working
          with difficult people.
